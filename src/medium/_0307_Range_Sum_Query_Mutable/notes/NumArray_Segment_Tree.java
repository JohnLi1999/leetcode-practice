    /*  Time complexity: O(n)
            we calculate the sum of one node during each iteration of the for loop.
            There are approximately 2n nodes in a segment tree.
            This could be proved in the following way:
            Segmented tree for array with n elements has n leaves (the array elements itself).
            The number of nodes in each level is half the number in the level below.
            So if we sum the number by level we will get:
            n + n/2 + n/4 + n/8 + ... + 1 â‰ˆ 2n
        Space complexity : O(n)O(n).
            We used 2n extra space to store the segment tree.
